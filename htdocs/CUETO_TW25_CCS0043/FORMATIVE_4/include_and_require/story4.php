        Finally, the day came when Midnight heard the familiar sound of her owner's footsteps at 
        the door. Her heart raced with excitement as she dashed to greet them, her tail held high in joy. 
        The moment their eyes met, it was as if time stood still. Midnight was about to leap into
        her owner's arms.

        However, a loud thunderclap was heard. Midnight suddenly woke up. Her eyes roam the room, 
        only for her to realize it was just a dream. She was still alone, curled up on the couch,
        waiting for her owner to return. The dream felt so real, and the longing in her heart was
        stronger than ever. Midnight knew she had to hold on to the hope that one day, her dream would
        become a reality.
