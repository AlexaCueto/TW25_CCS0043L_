        The days grew longer, and Midnight's patience was tedted. She curled up on the couch, trying to 
        find comfort in the soft cushions, but her heart ached with loneliness. The house felt like a shell,
        devoid of the warmth and love that her owner brought. Midnight's days were filled with quiet moments.

        For each time she would hear a car pass by, her ears would perk up, and she would rush to the window,
        only to be met with disappointment as the car drove away, leaving her alone once more. Midnight's
        heart sank each time, but she refused to give up hope. She knew her owner would return, and she would
        be there, waiting with her unwavering love and loyalty.
