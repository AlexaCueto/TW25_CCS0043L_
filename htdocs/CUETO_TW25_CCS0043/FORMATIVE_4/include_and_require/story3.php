        As the days turned into weeks, Midnight found herself lost in memories of her owner. She would often
        sit by the window, gazing out at the world beyond, her mind drifting to the times they spent together.
        The laughter, the gentle strokes of her owner's hand, and the warmth of their shared moments filled her
        heart with a bittersweet ache.

        Midnight would curl up in her owner's favorite chair, inhaling the faint scent of their presence that
        lingered in the fabric. She would close her eyes and imagine her owner sitting there, reading a book,
        or simply enjoying the quiet company of their beloved cat. These moments of reminiscence brought both
        comfort and sorrow, as Midnight longed for the day when they would be reunited.
